# AWSGoat : A Damn Vulnerable AWS Infrastructure

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65826354/179526664-cb123612-7f9a-41fe-bab2-eb6b3b2518d7.png)

Compromising an organization's cloud infrastructure is like sitting on a gold mine for attackers. And sometimes, a simple misconfiguration or a vulnerability in web applications, is all an attacker needs to compromise the entire infrastructure. Since the cloud is relatively new, many developers are not fully aware of the threatscape and they end up deploying a vulnerable cloud infrastructure.

AWSGoat is a vulnerable by design infrastructure on AWS featuring the latest released OWASP Top 10 web application security risks (2021) and other misconfiguration based on services such as IAM, S3, API Gateway, Lambda, EC2, and ECS. AWSGoat mimics real-world infrastructure but with added vulnerabilities. It features multiple escalation paths and is focused on a black-box approach.

AWSGoat uses IaC (Terraform) to deploy the vulnerable cloud infrastructure on the user's AWS account. This gives the user complete control over code, infrastructure, and environment. Using AWSGoat, the user can learn/practice:
- Cloud Pentesting/Red-teaming
- Auditing IaC
- Secure Coding
- Detection and mitigation


The project will be divided into modules and each module will be a separate web application, powered by varied tech stacks and development practices. It will leverage IaC through terraform and GitHub actions to ease the deployment process.

## Built With

* AWS
* React
* Python 3
* Terraform
* PHP 
* Docker 

## Vulnerabilities

The project is scheduled to encompass all significant vulnerabilities including the OWASP TOP 10 2021, and popular cloud misconfigurations.
Currently, the project  contains the following vulnerabilities/misconfigurations.

* XSS
* SQL Injection
* Insecure Direct Object Reference
* Server Side Request Forgery on Lambda Environment
* Sensitive Data Exposure and Password Reset
* S3 Misconfigurations
* IAM Privilege Escalations
* ECS Container Breakout


# Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* An AWS Account
* AWS Access Key with Administrative Privileges
* OR use the IAM policy in the [policy.json](policy/policy.json) file for the minimum permissions required for an AWS Access Key.


### Installation

To ease the deployment process the user just needs to fork this repo, add their AWS Account Credentials to GitHub secrets, and run the Terraform Apply Action. This workflow will deploy the whole infrastructure and output the hosted application's URL. 

Here are the steps to follow:

**Step 1.** Fork the repo

**Step 2.** Set the GitHub Action Secrets:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

### Manual Installation

Manually installing AWSGoat would require you to follow these steps:

(Note: This requires a Linux Machine, with the /bin/bash shell available)

**Step 1.** Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ine-labs/AWSGoat
```

**Step 2.** Configure AWS User Account Credentials
```sh
aws configure
```

**Step 3.** Traverse into the respective modules' directory and use terraform to deploy AWSGoat
```sh
cd modules/module-<Number>
terraform init
terraform apply --auto-approve
```
